    Analyze the following Reddit post and determine whether the user is experiencing stress. Think step by step before providing the final classification.

    Post: "{input_text}"

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1. Identify key phrases related to stress, such as frustration, overwhelm, anxiety, or emotional distress.
    2. Determine if the user describes external stressors (e.g., work, relationships, finances).
    3. Assess whether the user expresses difficulty coping with situations.
    4. Based on this reasoning, classify the post into one of the following categories:

    - Stressed (1): If the post indicates high emotional distress, anxiety, or external pressure.
    - Not Stressed (0): If the post does not indicate significant stress or distress.

    You are analyzing a Reddit post to determine whether the user is experiencing stress.
    Instead of a single reasoning path, generate **three different thought trees** to explore multiple perspectives.

    Post: "{input_text}"

    **Tree 1: Emotional & Sentiment Analysis**
    - Identify key emotions (e.g., frustration, anxiety, exhaustion).
    - Does the user express feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope?
    - Differentiate between temporary frustration and chronic stress.

    **Tree 2: External & Social Stressors**
    - Does the user describe external stressors (e.g., work, relationships, finances)?
    - Are they experiencing social isolation, burnout, or high pressure?
    - Are there mentions of seeking support or struggling alone?

    **Tree 3: Coping Mechanisms & Resilience**
    - Is there evidence of positive coping (e.g., exercise, relaxation, problem-solving)?
    - Are there maladaptive coping mechanisms (e.g., avoidance, substance use)?
    - How well is the user managing their stressors?

    **Evaluation & Final Classification**
    - Compare insights from all three thought trees.
    - Determine the most supported classification:
      - **Stressed (1)**: If the post indicates significant distress, anxiety, or external stressors.
      - **Not Stressed (0)**: If the post does not indicate overwhelming stress.

    Return only the final classification [0 OR 1] in a structured JSON response with the following format: {json.dumps(exp_temp)}.
